Και σε αυτό το επεισόδιο θα μπορούσα να πω μόνο ένα μικρό κομμάτι από τη σύγχρονη έκδοση του διαιρεμένου νησιού της Κύπρου. Αλλά για αυτό είναι οι σειρές! υπάρχουν τρία ακόμη επεισόδια σε αυτή τη σειρά και το επόμενο θα ρίξει μια πιο προσεκτική ματιά στο πώς φαίνεται όλο αυτό σήμερα. Πώς είναι να ζεις σε ένα διαιρεμένο νησί. Το επεισόδιο 3 θα μπει στη συνέχεια στα βόρεια του νησιού, μιλώντας με Τουρκοκύπριους και ακούγοντας την ιστορία τους. Το επεισόδιο 4 δεν είναι τόσο σοβαρό. Πρόκειται για γαϊδούρια.\nΔεν υπάρχει περίπτωση να πω όλες τις ιστορίες και αν είστε από αυτό το νησί, πιθανότατα έχετε μια έκδοση αυτών των ιστοριών που δεν ταιριάζει με αυτά που έχω πει εδώ. Παρακαλώ απλά εμπιστευτείτε ότι προσπάθησα για το καλύτερο."

Ama diziler bunun için var! Bu dizide üç bölüm daha var ve bir sonraki bölüm, tüm bunların bugün nasıl göründüğüne daha yakından bakacak. Bölünmüş bir adada yaşamak nasıl bir duygu. 3. Bölüm daha sonra adanın kuzeyine inecek, Kıbrıslı Türklerle konuşacak ve hikayelerini dinleyecek. 4. bölüm o kadar da ciddi değil. Eşeklerle ilgili.\nTüm hikayeleri anlatmamın imkanı yok ve eğer bu adadan iseniz, muhtemelen bu hikayelerin burada anlattığıma uymayan bir versiyonuna sahipsiniz. Lütfen sadece güven, elimden geleni yaptım."

      "description": "It's a story of a certain type of capitalism \nIf you want to learn more,  check out this article from the WEF https://bit.ly/39s92kl or for a deeper dive, the full book was published yesterday (I've read it. it's good!): https://amzn.to/3ordkwC\nThis video is a story about China, past to present. But in telling the story of the Rise of China (and Asia generally), it's impossible to not talk about fundamental lessons that have emerged. In this video I try to tell the story but then also look back and at the result of it all. To examine the data and see what effects our global economic system has had on people and the planet. The data is clear that our model of capitalism has some major winners. But it also produces some important losers, those who have lost out or have been damaged by these trends. One major loser of the this system is the future generations of people who will live on a planet with more extreme and volatile weather and ocean patterns. All of this calls for a rethinking of our capitalism. Not to scrap it all together, but to upgrade it to a version that benefits all of society and doesn't threaten our planet and future generations. \nThanks for watching. \n-Johnny\n\n- ways to support - \nMy Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/johnnyharris\nOur custom Presets & LUTs: https://store.dftba.com/products/johnny-iz-luts-and-presets\n\n- where to find me -\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/johnny.harris/\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@johnny.harris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JohnnyHarrisVox\nIz's (my wife’s) channel: https://www.youtube.com/iz-harris\n\n- how i make my videos -\nTom Fox makes my music, work with him here: https://tfbeats.com/\nI make maps using this AE Plugin: https://aescripts.com/geolayers/?aff=77\nAll the gear I use: https://www.izharris.com/gear-guide\n \n- my courses - \nLearn a language: https://brighttrip.com/course/language/\nVisual storytelling: https://www.brighttrip.com/courses/visual-storytelling\n\n- about -\nJohnny Harris is a filmmaker and journalist.

        "description": "It's a story of a certain type of capitalism \nIf you want to learn more,  check out this article from the WEF https://bit.ly/39s92kl or for a deeper dive, the full book was published yesterday (I've read it. it's good!): https://amzn.to/3ordkwC\nThis video is a story about China, past to present. But in telling the story of the Rise of China (and Asia generally), it's impossible to not talk about fundamental lessons that have emerged. In this video I try to tell the story but then also look back and at the result of it all. To examine the data and see what effects our global economic system has had on people and the planet. The data is clear that our model of capitalism has some major winners. But it also produces some important losers, those who have lost out or have been damaged by these trends. One major loser of the this system is the future generations of people who will live on a planet with more extreme and volatile weather and ocean patterns. All of this calls for a rethinking of our capitalism. Not to scrap it all together, but to upgrade it to a version that benefits all of society and doesn't threaten our planet and future generations. \nThanks for watching. \n-Johnny\n\n- ways to support - \nMy Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/johnnyharris\nOur custom Presets & LUTs: https://store.dftba.com/products/johnny-iz-luts-and-presets\n\n- where to find me -\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/johnny.harris/\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@johnny.harris\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JohnnyHarrisVox\nIz's (my wife’s) channel: https://www.youtube.com/iz-harris\n\n- how i make my videos -\nTom Fox makes my music, work with him here: https://tfbeats.com/\nI make maps using this AE Plugin: https://aescripts.com/geolayers/?aff=77\nAll the gear I use: https://www.izharris.com/gear-guide\n \n- my courses - \nLearn a language: https://brighttrip.com/course/language/\nVisual storytelling: https://www.brighttrip.com/courses/visual-storytelling\n\n- about -\nJohnny Harris is a filmmaker and journalist.
