Brian Peckford and I discussed his reentry to the political arena after denouncing the Canadian Government for infringements on the Canadian Charter of Rights--a document he played a key role in drafting. In this intense conversation, Peckford outlines a combined plan of action against the Canadian Government over their COVID-19 response and ongoing use of power.

Starting his career as an educator, the Honorable Brian Peckford then served as the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador for nearly a decade. He is also an author, former minister, and notable member of the PC Party.

This episode was recorded on September 15th, 2021.
Chloé Valdary and I discuss The Theory of Enchantment, her personal brand of compassionate anti-racism. Chloé has been featured in Psychology Today and the NY Times. Her work with Theory of Enchantment attempts to bring compassion to diversity training and fight bigotry with love.
We covered a range of topics surrounding her practice, structural racism in the US, the civil rights movement, the best way to criticize one another, the power of Truth, white fragility, and what one could expect from her (rather unique) diversity seminars.

We use stories to understand the world around us. It’s the reason that we appreciate a beautiful poem, why our breath is taken away during an epic movie, and get transported to another world while reading a great book. 

Any great piece of music is a story, with the lyrics used, but also even the instrumental arrangements. It’s hard to argue that any of the great orchestral pieces from Beethoven or Bach don’t tell a complex story, even when no words are used.

Stories, and Narrative in general, allow us to play games for fun, construct cooperative relationships in business and in life, and help us successfully navigate the most difficult parts of our lives. 

From birth to death, every day of our lives is inundated by story. Part one of this compilation focuses on season 4 conversations between Jordan, Randall Wallace, Chloe Valdery (released soon) and Angus Fletcher. We hope you enjoy this narrative.

This episode was recorded on October 11th, 2021.

Dr. Arif Ahmed and Dr. James Orr come on to discuss what led to the University of Cambridge rescinding my invitation to speak there. We get into the difficulty of change in universities, anonymous reporting, the dangers of limiting free speech, microaggressions, the importance of humor, and more.

Arif Ahmed MBE is a philosopher, lecturer at Cambridge, and author of “Saul Kripke”. His interests include decision theory and religion from an atheist and libertarian point of view. In the aftermath of the Cambridge incident, Dr. Ahmed remained a vocal advocate for political diversity. 

Dr. James Orr is a university lecturer in philosophy of religion at Cambridge and author of “The Mind of God and the Works of Nature.” He is a regular contributor to The Times Literary Supplement and The Critic.

[41:46] "The idea that you should remove everything that could threaten someone's identity and you should make that a university-wide policy is actually, exactly the opposite of what you should do, speaking clinically if you're trying to help people become more resilient" - Dr. Peterson
[44:32] Microaggressions and the importance of humor

Mikhail Avdeev interviews Jordan Peterson in this episode.
Jordan Peterson has as strong of an international following as ever with his lectures translated into fourteen languages. On his last speaking tour, he visited thirty plus number of countries speaking on the twelve rules and continues to foster relationships and connections with thinkers, speakers, and fans from around the globe.

Shownotes:
[00:00] Jordan Petersons is interviewed in this episode by Mikhail Avdeev, a member of his foreign translations team. The interview focuses on the impact of Petersons work beyond the western world on the international community as a whole. They begin the discussion by talking about the forming of the international translation teams.
[02:00] The healing effect of Jordan's lectures on people's personal life. The outcry for new material from jordans catalog of books, lectures, and podcasts has been overwhelming. 
[05:20] Peterson comments on another personal favorite author of his Mircea Eliade and his history of Religious Ideas. It’s an anthropological and sociological assessment of religion but it’s also deeply psychological.
[06:40] How do Russian views respond to Jordan's affinity for Alexander Solzhenitsyn? Mikail details the feelings of the Russian people by their portrayal after the fall of communism.
[10:00] How we deal with the guilt of the things our ancestors or society has done is a very difficult question because as humans we are very historical creatures. The best thing for us is to try to understand what happened and therefore try not to do it again in the future because all of us are living with this to some degree.
[13:30] examining the trope that all white people are racist or white supremacist and this stems from the existential guilt of history.
[20:00] Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett seem to equate that religious belief is a set of propositions about the material world, in a way a direct competitor to scientific theory, and that’s just not fully accurate. There is something outside of strictly rationality in the human experience.
[34:20] Fragmentation of the value structure necessarily leads to an increased level of constant anxiety in all experience
[36:30] What parts of modern society are contributing to the integrity of consciousness, and what things are degrading that. A hatred for real success and striving for personal gain will tear us apart if it continues unchecked.
[43:30] There is no doubt that economic exploitation occurs and that some wealth is gained in an unethical manner, but that is not the rule.
[45:45] - Asking about the importance of beauty in all of our personal experiences as well as our collective experience as humans.
[51:00] interesting to consider the differences in Fyodor Dostoevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche closeness to the ideal of beauty
[56:30] The complexity of the language of Beyond Order:12 More Rules for Life. What is Jordan's process for increasing the precision of his speech and writing? 
[1:03:30] The divinity of the true word and the way this has been translated through Jordan’s book Beyond Order. Peterson's philosophy behind good writing and text structure of a truly complete work.
[1:13:40] Mikhaila Peterson has had to choose to be strong because she has had so much suffering to overcome in her life. It’s wonderful to see her succeeding in her personal endeavors like her weekly podcast.
[1:20:15] How do we best teach our children in a way that fosters their individual growth and a love of learning.

[10:00] How we deal with the guilt of the things our ancestors or society has done is a very difficult question because as humans we are very historical creatures. The best thing for us is to try to understand what happened and therefore try not to do it again in the future because all of us are living with this to some degree.
[13:30] examining the trope that all white people are racist or white supremacist and this stems from the existential guilt of history.
[20:00] Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett seem to equate that religious belief is a set of propositions about the material world, in a way a direct competitor to scientific theory, and that’s just not fully accurate. There is something outside of strictly rationality in the human experience.
[34:20] Fragmentation of the value structure necessarily leads to an increased level of constant anxiety in all experience
[36:30] What parts of modern society are contributing to the integrity of consciousness, and what things are degrading that. A hatred for real success and striving for personal gain will tear us apart if it continues unchecked.
[43:30] There is no doubt that economic exploitation occurs and that some wealth is gained in an unethical manner, but that is not the rule.
[45:45] - Asking about the importance of beauty in all of our personal experiences as well as our collective experience as humans.
[51:00] interesting to consider the differences in Fyodor Dostoevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche closeness to the ideal of beauty
[56:30] The complexity of the language of Beyond Order:12 More Rules for Life. What is Jordan's process for increasing the precision of his speech and writing? 
[1:03:30] The divinity of the true word and the way this has been translated through Jordan’s book Beyond Order. Peterson's philosophy behind good writing and text structure of a truly complete work.
[1:13:40] Mikhaila Peterson has had to choose to be strong because she has had so much suffering to overcome in her life. It’s wonderful to see her succeeding in her personal endeavors like her weekly podcast.
[1:20:15] How do we best teach our children in a way that fosters their individual growth and a love of learning.

      <title>S4 E73: Evolution &amp; the Challenges of Modern Life | Bret Weinstein &amp; Heather Heying</title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on October 5th, 2021.

Podcasters and evolutionary biology power-couple Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying join me to discuss a variety of topics related to their new book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century. We explore topics like niche-switching, what Darwin got wrong, Twitter, sources for modern values, hyper-novelty, the aftermath of progress, parenthood, and sexual selection – just to name a few.

Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying are evolutionary biologists, former Evergreen State College professors, and the current hosts of the DarkHorse podcast. You may also know Bret through Joe Rogan, or as the twice-moderator for Jordan’s debates with Sam Harris.

The couple’s book, titled “A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life,” asks why the most prosperous age in history has scarcely offset suicide rates, tribal division, loneliness, and human misery.

[00:00] Intro

[00:30] Guests’ background

[01:32] A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century – why they wrote it

[04:30] “Values might not be [scientifically] defensible. Taken to the extreme, it might be hard to explain why existing is better than not" - Bret Weinstein

[05:07] “We believe that any credible 'ought' needs to be scientifically informed" - BW

[05:45] Learning to negotiate hyper-novelty in the modern world. The extremely fast rate of progress and change

[06:56] “The amazing rate of change we’ve created is itself deranging us and making it very difficult to understand and remember how to be human” - Heather Heying

[08:18] “It's not that progress is bad – the benefit of progress is often tremendous, but it almost always comes with important unintended consequences” - BW

[09:26] Our incredible ability to adapt by “niche-switching”

[15:41] Unintended consequences &amp; modern sleeping

[22:45] Twitter as a giant social experiment; what happens when you can (sort of) communicate with everyone?

[25:22] “If people treated each other the way they do on Twitter, they’d get beaten up with enough regularity to stop them. So the net effect [might make us] nicer, right?” - BW

[25:47] The importance of nonverbal communication; physical and chemical ways humans communicate

[29:57] Small talk, gaging social skills, and nonverbal cues

[31:28] “Small talk lets you take a room’s temperature–literally and metaphorically" - Heather Heying

[32:35] Objections to evolutionary theory: A critique of some key Darwinian tenets

[38:28] Play &amp; Evolution

[42:08] Intelligence in mate selection amongst bowerbirds

[53:12] How Heather conceptualizes male/female status hierarchies

[55:57] Sex, gender, and how they’re linked

[01:06:44] The Hero's journey and the importance of new storytelling

[01:13:42] The adaptive valley picture in evolutionary biology

[01:13:46] “I'm trying to update our understanding of stories rather than the stories themselves" - Jordan Peterson

[01:21:29] podcasts &amp; collective listening

[01:27:26] Parenting &amp; Children

[01:27:46] “Children will destroy your life and replace it with a better one" - BW

[01:28:52] Parenting &amp; Relationships

[01:30:03] Wrapping up

      <title>S4 E72: The Problem with Atheism </title>
      <description>In this week’s compilation, we explore the idea of what happens when the religious instinct gets brushed aside – and the things that fill that void instead. Things that, depending on who you ask, may be actively contributing to the breakdown of a society founded on the Abrahamic tradition.

Nietzsche has his famous God quote, “God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods, simply to appear worthy of it?”

The voices in this compilation may be very familiar since some of them are also featured in the Conceptualization of God series. You’re about to hear from the whole spectrum: through Jonathan Pageau and Matthew Petrusek to Stephen Fry and Lawrence Krauss, just to name a few.

      <title>S4 E71: Fortitude: American Resilience | Dan Crenshaw </title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on September 30, 2021.

Congressman Dan Crenshaw and I discuss the fallout of withdrawing from Afghanistan and the details of the 20-plus-year conflict. We talk about life as a US congressman and his experience as a US Navy SEAL. About social media and politics–especially in relation to modern conservatism. And about climate change. On that note, we also examined Dan’s recently-published ”Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage.”

Dan is a retired Navy SEAL with five deployments overseas during the Afghan and Iraq wars. While in Afghanistan, an IED blast led to Dan losing his right eye. Crenshaw was elected to Congress in 2018, where he serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee (broadest jurisdiction out of all legislative committees). Dan also serves on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.

On that note, we also examined Dan’s recently-published ”Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dan is a retired Navy SEAL with five deployments overseas during the Afghan and Iraq wars. While in Afghanistan, an IED blast led to Dan losing his right eye. Crenshaw was elected to Congress in 2018, where he serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee (broadest jurisdiction out of all legislative committees). Dan also serves on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. </p><p><br></p><p>Find more Dan Crenshaw: @DanCrenshawTX</p><p>https://twitter.com/DanCrenshawTX</p><p><br></p><p>Or on his website: https://crenshaw.house.gov/</p><p><br></p><p>Check out "Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage":</p><p>https://www.amazon.com/Fortitude-American-Resilience-Era-Outrage/dp/1538733307</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>S4 E70: Don't Climate Panic - An Investigation into The Proposed Solutions to Climate Change</title>
      <description>Over the past few weeks, we have been looking at the reality of the state of the world; not what the corporate media says, not what the politicians are saying, but a new voice - the voice of data. In the previous two episodes, we looked at the Progress of the Human Race. Today, we are tackling the topic of Climate Change. Are we experiencing an increasingly worsening climate? Is it possible that rising temperatures and tides will kill us all?

Thankfully, there are a growing number of reputable scientists and authors that are presenting a much more optimistic story than the narrative we typically hear. Using the same data sets as many of the climate alarmists, people like Bjorn Lomborg, Michael Shellenberger, Marian Tupy, and Matt Ridley have been speaking to the idea that climate change is real, it’s just not the apocalyptic threat that we’ve been told it is.

      <title>S4 E69: Jordan Peterson, God, and Christianity with Word on Fire </title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on September 6, 2021.

Dr. Christopher Kaczor, Dr. Matthew Petrusek, and I discuss their new book “Jordan Peterson, God, and Christianity”—the first systematic analysis of 12 Rules for Life and my biblical series from a Christian perspective. We also cover—just to name a few—truth in fiction, time before consciousness, faith, evolution, love, and acting as if God exists.

Dr. Christopher Kaczor is a Professor of Philosophy at Loyola Marymount University. He was appointed a Corresponding Member of the Pontifical Academy for Life of Vatican City, is a fellow of the Word on Fire Institute, and won a Templeton Grant for his work. He has written many scholarly articles and books.

Dr. Matthew R. Petrusek is an associate professor at Loyola Marymount University in LA. He holds an MA from Yale and a PhD from the University of Chicago. Dr. Petrusek specializes in Christian ethics and moral theology and lectures on a range of topics surrounding philosophy, theology, and Catholicism.

      <title>S4 E68: Voice of the Canadian West | Preston Manning</title>
      <description>Preston Manning and I discuss populist movements in the west, history building and storytelling, the power of reading audiences, the new tenets of conservatism, communication in politics, the Chinese Communist Party, and much more.

Manning (often called the “father of modern Canadian Conservatism") recounts the history of Canada’s Reform Party, which he founded, and his takeaways from a long career in politics–much of which he includes in books like “Faith, Leadership, and Public Life: Leadership Lessons from Moses to Jesus” and “Think Big: Adventures in Life and Democracy.” Upon his retirement, he founded the Manning Foundation for Democratic Education and the Manning Centre for Building Democracy, not-for-profit organizations dedicated to strengthening Canadian democracy in line with conservative principles.

      <title>S4 E67: Progress of the Human Race, Part 2</title>
      <description>This is part two of our investigation into the Progress of the Human Race, and we would like to restate our goal here. All the mainstream media ever talk about is how the world’s in dire straits, how we’re going in an irreversible direction, and how it’s all our fault. We explored this narrative in depth in season 4 of the podcast. And we’d like to promote an alternative narrative–one where, in almost every direction you look, you find progress at a rate that, for most of history, would sound like sci-fi.

This episode, part two, once again heavily features Marian Tupy, dad’s guest on episode 14 of the current podcast season. Marian is a senior fellow at Cato Institute’s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity and co-authored the incredible book “Ten Global Trends Every Smart Person Should Know,” which I’m sure many of you will know.

Also featured in this episode are Michael Shellenberger, Dr. Saifedean Ammous, Viscount Matt Ridley, Steven Pinker, and Bjorn Lomborg.

      <title>S4 E66: Islam and the Possibilities of Peace | Mohammed Hijab</title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on November 10th, 2021.

In this episode, philosopher Mohammed Hijab joined me to discuss a wide array of topics, such as the traditionalist interpretation of Islam, its metanarrative, the story of the prophet Muhammad, and some common ground among monotheistic Abrahamic religions.

Mohammed Hijab is an author and philosopher whose main interests lie in political philosophy, philosophy of religion, and comparative religion. He seeks to spread a better understanding of traditionalist Islam while engaging with prominent thinkers and philosophers worldwide.

[00:00] Intro
[01:48] What beliefs and practices are central to Islam?
[04:12] Islam’s unmoved mover argument for God and the universe
[07:30] “Things made of parts... must be contingent on being created by something else, a sorting mechanism [that] doesn’t necessitate [creation itself].” Mohammed Hijab
[08:25] “It is problematic, through the lens of Islam... for there to be a god of a triune nature like [in] Christianity.” MH
[08:58] “Islam does not believe that there’s an element of divinity... in human beings.” MH
[10:09] “The word Islam does not mean peace; it means submission. Islam believes that everything in the universe submits to God.” MH
[10:57] The metanarrative of Islam
[12:12] Mohammed’s view of worship and belief
[12:48] “We believe in... the inherent belief in God implanted in humans.” MH
[15:20] What’s the purpose of belief?
[17:00] The instinct for God arguments vs new atheists
[18:27] The Muslim ideal for worship, compared
[24:36] Muslims and Christians as followers of Jesus Christ
[27:59] How does Dr. Peterson envision the spark of divinity?
[28:25] “The divine spark is embodied virtue... reflective of the highest value, operating at a local scale.” JP
[29:42] How are the attributes of God knowable to a Muslim? The importance of the original version of the Quran
[35:07] “Islam is an evangelizing religion... we want everyone to embrace it.” MH
[35:31] Bridges to Islam
[38:50] “I’m speaking from the perspective of someone who’s a traditionalist Muslim and not a liberal or enlightened Muslim.” MH
[40:47] An abridged story of the prophet Muhammad. The Mecca and Medina periods. Rationalizing the warrior emphasis of many Muslim teachings
[44:10] Muhammad’s warrior traits and Hijab’s interpretation
[49:20] Exploring the terms “warlord” and “defensive wars.”
[50:54] In Hijab’s opinion, what’s the central driving force behind the expansion of Islam?
[52:10] “Islam has the capability of being expansive through war... and of making peace treaties. It does and should do whatever’s in its best interest, just like every country.” MH
[55:39] Against totalitarianism
[58:46] “Evangelising isn’t the same as compelling.” MH
[58:56] “Let the best story win. I would say that the proper mode of conversion is something like a shining example.” JP
[01:00:28] M.Hijab on western misconceptions of Islam
[01:03:20] Other seldom-discussed aspects of Islam
[01:08:53] M.Hijab’s take on the war in Serbia
[01:11:05] The economic output of Islamic countries
[01:15:18] M.Hijab on why the traditionalist view is superior to a liberal one

      <title>S4 E65: The Progress of the Human Race, Part 1 </title>
      <description>All we ever hear about on the mainstream news is that the world is in dire straights, that we are going in an irreversible direction, and that it is all our fault. Throughout many conversations in Season 4 of this podcast, we have explored these narratives in depth. We would like to promote an alternative narrative...

Did you know that in 1981, 42% of the world’s population was living in what is called “absolute poverty” and by 2018, that number had fallen to 8.1%? By 2030, we are on pace to have less than 5% of the world’s population living in poverty. 

Are you aware that alongside nearly eradicating poverty, we have also nearly ended world hunger? Over the last 50 years, we have added nearly 1,000 calories per day to the world food supply average. The world’s poorest region, Sub-Saharan Africa, has roughly the same access to food as Portugal did in the 1960s. As of the last survey in 2017, only 2 out of 173 nations in the world have food access averages under 2,000 calories per day. 

We have also drastically increased the supply of tree coverage across the globe, resources are being used more efficiently than ever before, and the global economy has grown by over 100x over the last 200 hundred years.

There are legitimate reasons to be concerned about certain specific issues that we still need to improve; but overall, the data is undeniable. We are living in an age of seemingly-impossible progress in nearly every sector imaginable.

      <title>S4 E64: Fix This: Infrastructure &amp; Environment | Gregg Hurwitz and Rick Geddes | JBP Podcast </title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on November 9th, 2021.

Jordan Peterson, Gregg Hurwitz, and Rick Geddes meet to discuss the debate surrounding the multi-billion dollar infrastructure bill currently going through the US congress.

Rick Geddes is a professor in the Department of Policy Analysis and Management at Cornell University and a well-recognized expert in American infrastructure policy and development. He has done extensive research on infrastructure, including but not limited to the funding, financing, operation, and maintenance of major projects with a focus on new technologies.

Gregg Hurwitz was today’s co-host. Gregg is a former student of Jordan’s at Harvard. He is now a bestselling scriptwriter, producer, and novelist. In the years leading up to the presidential election, Gregg has been working with an independent team of Hollywood writers, producers, and directors to design a moderate, far-reaching political message for the democratic party.

[00:00] Intro
[00:30] Jordan introduces this week’s guests to discuss the newly-proposed infrastructure legislation (winter '21)—a crucial bill for the American people
[03:28] Geddes gives an overview of infrastructure and his background therein
[07:46] The monumental accomplishment of the US interstate highway system. Could it be built again today?
[11:10] “You've heard the adage that time is money. [That's] certainly the case with infrastructure. When a project gets delayed by the NEPA process for say 5 years, the amount of extra money spent... is enormous, it can sometimes double" Rick Geddes
[14:42] Gregg Hurwitz highlights the unsophisticated way the media and most politicians are currently handling the infrastructure bill
[16:02] “It seems like we can get very little sane discussion in the media on the role that regulation plays in building a renewing infrastructure" GH
[16:40] Extra delay and cost in federally funded projects is a regressive tax that hurts the poor and middle class
[22:02] Pressure on the infrastructure bill from climate change. Looking at the evolution of new technologies to improve the efficiency of current infrastructure
[25:49] “If infrastructure development means replacing inefficient use of resources with efficient use of resources, that should be a net gain on the economic side, so it helps poor people, and it should also have environmental benefits" Dr. Peterson
[26:07] What are our current top infrastructure priorities? What needs to be addressed and fixed ASAP?
[35:31] We need to capitalize more on the utility of combined public and private ventures in infrastructure projects
[52:32] The importance of defining and communicating what a successful infrastructure project looks like
[55:36] Given our systemic problems, how can we give politicians and private firms a positive incentive for meaningful participation?
[01:03:14] You can only focus on so many projects before outsourcing becomes a necessity
[01:12:19] You'd be extremely naive to believe that the people sustaining our infrastructure systems are only in it for personal gain
[01:16:48] The extraordinary reliability of the societal infrastructure system
[01:18:47] “The idea that it's just power that drives people to the top of organizations isn't true because, if it were, we would have many more psychopaths and they would be way more successful" JP
[01:23:15] What about infrastructure projects that should be started immediately?
[01:25:44] “This is the ultimate bipartisan thing because it will reduce greenhouse gases, diesel emissions, improve the efficiency of our infrastructure, and it's right there on the table" RG

      <title>S4 E63: The Symbolic World | A Lecture by Jonathan Pageau</title>
      <description>Our friend Jonathan Pageau gave a lecture on the conceptual structure of Genesis for an event that was orchestrated by the Montreal Jung Society. Jordan felt that this lecture would serve as a wonderful adjunct to his biblical series, also on Genesis, featured on this channel. 

Thank you to the Montreal Jung Society and Jonathan for letting us release this video on our channel. We hope that you find it useful. Visit sites.google.com/site/cgjungmontreal for more info on the Montreal Jung Society.

Event Title: The Symbolic World - a lecture by Jonathan Pageau

Event Description: “Meaning is showing itself to no longer be an overlay to an arbitrary world of phenomena, but rather the very pattern of reality.
 
Through the questions of emergence, attention, and consciousness which have been permeating so many fields in the recent past, the reality of pattern, ritual and image have also come to the fore. Meaning is showing itself, in a burgeoning post-secular age, as no longer only a subjective overlay to an arbitrary world of phenomena, but rather the very pattern of reality itself. In this frame we come to realize that the archetypal truths are not mostly biological and mental constructs in humans; they are firstly the inescapable patterning of the indefinite potential of the world as it encounters intelligence.”

      <title>S4 E62: The Uniting Power of Story | Angus Fletcher | Jordan B. Peterson Podcast</title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on September 7, 2021.

Angus Fletcher and I discuss creativity, the link between literature and resilience, what makes for compelling narratives, the different kinds of stories, and much more.

Angus Fletcher is a Professor of Story Science at Ohio State's Project Narrative, the world's leading academic think-tank for narrative theory. He is also the author of Wonderworks: The 25 Most Important Inventions in the History of Literature.

[00:00] Intro
[01:21] What is Project Narrative?
[02:27] "Stories are the most powerful things ever invented. They're the most powerful tool we possess" Angus Fletcher
[03:04] "When you realize stories have the power to change how our mind works, to troubleshoot it, to make it more resilient, more creative, more scientific—to do all these things... When you couple the power of stories with the human brain, you throw open the doors to anything" AF
[03:53] The problem with literary studies. How stories empower us and improve performance
[07:06] Wonderworks and the story of courage in Homer's Iliad
[12:40] "Literature and scripture are synonyms. They mean 'that which is written.' So [something] more fundamental than any technology... Is simply that sense of spiritual experience" AF
[13:18] The Neuropsychology of Anxiety by J. Grey
[14:44] What are the 2 kinds of stories?
[19:12] Story thinking
[19:22] "Human cognition is largely narrative. We process the world narratively" AF
[22:12] "The wonder of being on this earth... is to build stories and [empower people] to tell their own" AF "And to unite us in a collective story so we can work towards the same ends" JP
[23:00] Why are certain stories so compelling?
[24:48] The zone of proximal development
[25:44] "Being enthralled is a manifestation of the instinct that specifies the zone of proximal development" JP
[31:24] The ideal spirit transcending the individual; Jung's Pleroma
[32:14] "The flip side of anxiety is creativity—they're both about restless energy" AF
[33:31] What's the source of dreams?
[33:55] "We have this vast knowledge in embodied action." A great storyteller takes "images that reflect a compelling pattern of behavior [and verbalizes them]” JP
[34:56] Abstract representation of patterns as a dream-source
[38:43] Computational power, stories, and the differences between the abstract and particular
[38:48] "Much of what drives the demand for higher computational resources is... producing artificial realities for fantasy simulation" JP 
[45:51] Christianity and Star Wars
[46:35] "Star Wars is Christianity for atheist nerds" JP
[46:56] "We are most happy when we don't perceive ourselves as inheriting an archetypal story" AF
[48:16] "We see in stories, and this is partly why our eyes are adapted... so that people can see [the white in] our eyes. It's really important because [our eyes point at] what they're interested in. We can see what they value [and] infer their motivation" JP
[50:36] Literature and psychedelic experiences
[51:27] "In psychotherapy... you're trying to hammer the person's narrative into a single... functional unit" JP
[55:31] Trauma, unconscious mapping, and dream analysis
[56:56] "Any territory you cannot perceive through the overlaid projection of a narrative map is traumatizing" JP 
[59:59] Jung, Joseph Campbell, and Erich Neumann
[01:02:51] Jung vs Darwin on stories
[01:10:18] "Literature can build emotional and intellectual resilience" AF
[01:14:55] Being adaptive is “to be emotionally and intellectually resilient" AF
[01:15:54] Creative training; measuring creativity

[01:30] Intro
[02:40] Everyone gives their answer to “What is meaning?”
[03:30] “We're using meaning as a metaphor... something similar to the way a sentence works. It has intelligibility to it that connects us to the world... so that we can interact and be informed by it” Jon Vervaeke
[07:22] “Our mental framing is transparent like a pair of glasses, but there are times we need to step back and, by taking the glasses off and examining them, consider our framing structure" JV
[09:10] “When you look at the world there is a central point of focus. When you focus on the point with your eyes it becomes very clear... until we no longer perceive anything by the edge of our vision. It's nothingness, it's just not there" Jordan Peterson
[13:56] Bishop Barron's view on meaning and religion
[14:23] “I would say that meaning is to be in a purposeful relationship to a value" Bishop Robert Barron
[17:55] “So I'm talking to you, which I believe is a good, but it's nested in a higher good and a still higher good, so finally I want not just this particular good but good itself—that's a religious relationship" BRB
[18:20] Pageau’s opening thoughts on meaning and religion
[19:56] “The reason we perceive hierarchy is because we are always judging... or trying to evaluate whether something’s good" Pageau
[20:31] Jordan’s brief foray into “mini-celebrations”
[21:53] The idea of revelation
[24:46] “It isn't obvious to me that we see objects—we see patterns" JP
[27:40] “Like a Rolling Stone—it wasn't the first song I liked, but it was the first that rocked my world and rearranged my mind, and I think that's where real value is" BRB

[01:30] Intro
[02:40] Everyone gives their answer to “What is meaning?”
[03:30] “We're using meaning as a metaphor... something similar to the way a sentence works. It has intelligibility to it that connects us to the world... so that we can interact and be informed by it” Jon Vervaeke
[07:22] “Our mental framing is transparent like a pair of glasses, but there are times we need to step back and, by taking the glasses off and examining them, consider our framing structure" JV
[09:10] “When you look at the world there is a central point of focus. When you focus on the point with your eyes it becomes very clear... until we no longer perceive anything by the edge of our vision. It's nothingness, it's just not there" Jordan Peterson
[13:56] Bishop Barron's view on meaning and religion
[14:23] “I would say that meaning is to be in a purposeful relationship to a value" Bishop Robert Barron
[17:55] “So I'm talking to you, which I believe is a good, but it's nested in a higher good and a still higher good, so finally I want not just this particular good but good itself—that's a religious relationship" BRB
[18:20] Pageau’s opening thoughts on meaning and religion
[19:56] “The reason we perceive hierarchy is because we are always judging... or trying to evaluate whether something’s good" Pageau
[20:31] Jordan’s brief foray into “mini-celebrations”
[21:53] The idea of revelation
[24:46] “It isn't obvious to me that we see objects—we see patterns" JP
[27:40] “Like a Rolling Stone—it wasn't the first song I liked, but it was the first that rocked my world and rearranged my mind, and I think that's where real value is" BRB
[28:42] Underlying causes of the crisis of meaning
[30:10] “Something that starts with Scotus... and goes into the heart of the scientific revolution is that there’s no such thing as levels—reality just is" JV
[31:00] Science around the hierarchy of intelligibility and connectedness
[33:00] What is science?
[39:00] “There’s an epistemic hierarchy and science does not belong on the top" BRB
[42:00] “As scientists, we are motivated by a narrative we don't understand scientifically… The whole enterprise is driven by a dream whose reality can't be encapsulated within the process itself" JP
[44:00] The ignorance in assuming science OR religion are correct
[44:40] Eminationist ontologies
[55:30] Religious experiences
[01:07:30] The book of Revelations as a psychedelic experience.
[01:17:30] The Psychedelic problem and why psychedelics are useful in communal experiences.
[01:26:00] Jordan’s biblical lectures
[01:32:00] What are the guests working on?

[00:18] Intro
[02:34] What are hard monetary assets?
[06:13] The argument for bitcoin being the best hard money ever created
[09:11] "Bitcoin only has users... no admins. There is nobody with a master key" - Saifedean Ammous
[10:36] How the Bitcoin network functions using "consensus parameters"
[15:49] "The way that Bitcoin came about seems... virtually impossible to believe" - Jordan Peterson
[18:27] Other schools of economics (Austrian) vs. the most common today (Keynesian)
[20:46] "So the Austrian school of economics... tilts you more towards an appreciation of non-centrally controlled, distributed networks, and emphasis on the individual actor" - JP
[23:25] Paul Samuelson and communist economic expectations of centralized planning post-WW2
[25:27] Dr. Ammous' academic background
[27:14] Climate change. The push towards central planning, implying certain people or groups know the exact consequences and solutions to future economic developments
[29:41] "I've been struck by the problem of unintended consequences and the irreducible complexity of things. We can talk about the problem of climate change, but those words are incredibly deceiving" - JP
[34:16] Highlighting the crucial role of the entrepreneur in Austrian economics
[40:46] Saifedean reflects on the views held by the central bank, governments, and mainstream economists on money—as opposed to Bitcoin's structuring and the Austrian school of thought
[41:43] "From the Austrian perspective, money is a product of the market and not the invention of the state. The state's meddling in money... is irrational and cannot succeed for the same reasons central planning does not succeed" - SA
[45:50] Overview of Dr. Ammous' book The Fiat Standard
[54:40] Current inflation in Western democracies. The devastating effect of hyperinflation on the average person
[58:15] "Money is an incredible technology for lowering our time preference" - SA
[58:59] "The 20th century was a global trainwreck of watching the money preference rise. Generation after generation... witnessed their money devalue" - SA
[01:02:32] Why some efforts in energy production are misguided
[01:06:39] The Fiat Standard
[01:10:29] Why are we allowing people to mine bitcoin?
[01:12:46] The genius that went into the production of the Bitcoin code
[01:23:14] The crazy reality of decision-making at climate change panels
[01:26:36] Fiat-based currency jobs and the Zoom warriors disconnected from the physical world
[01:31:09] "A lot of the problems of the 20th century, in my opinion, have their roots in highly inflationary fiat currency" - SA
[01:31:18] Covering some of the common objections against Bitcoin
[01:39:45] "We are always going to find more reasons to print money" - SA
[01:41:43] Ammous’ online learning platform
[01:48:29] The growth of Saifedeen.com and the parameters attributed to its success
[01:50:05] The possibility of decentralizing societal accreditation
[01:50:21] "I've talked to seriously wise academics who know that there is almost zero financial knowledge in universities [today]... There is tremendous residual value, however, in the accreditation" - JP

      <title>S4 E57: Meaning, Awe and Conceptualization of God - pt. 1</title>
      <description>In our second weekly compilation, we are investigating the various methods and practices that humans use to conceptualize God. This investigation leads us down the path of exploring meaning and wonder. What does it mean to live as though God exists? Why are we awestruck when viewing a beautiful painting? Why does walking inside a great Cathedral render us speechless? What is the relationship between these experiences and God? 

Jordan talks about how living as though god exists is some form of evidence that we as a society hold these values in high regard.

      <title>S4: E56 Islam, Christ, and Liberty | Mustafa Akyol</title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on October 18th, 2021.

Mustafa Akyol joins me to discuss Muslim history and tradition. We touch on subjects like Jesus Christ from a Christian and Muslim perspective, the Virgin Mary's role in the Quran, separation of church and state as an ideology, the dangers of literalism when facing religious texts, and much more.

Mustafa Akyol is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, where he focuses on the intersection of public policy, Islam, and modernity. He's contributed as an opinion writer for the New York Times since 2013, covering politics and religion in the Muslim world.

Published by W. W. Norton, his 2011 book, "Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty," presents a strong argument for Islamic liberalism. The book was long-listed for the Lionel Gelber Prize for best nonfiction book. It was also praised by The Financial Times as "a forthright and elegant Muslim defense of freedom." His other books include "Reopening Muslim Minds" and "The Islamic Jesus."

[00:00] Introduction
[02:47] Regarding the separation of church and state, what do Christians and Muslims have in common?
[10:36] What are some similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?
[11:05] "I see the world's history, and I see a Judeo-Christian/Islamic history because it's all Abrahamic monotheism starting at Judaism." Mustafa Akyol
[11:46] What the Three Abrahamic religions have in common—monotheism, rooting in the same tradition; and strange insistence on a book as the bedrock of culture
[12:45] Unique ideas of religious and societal tolerance through different ages in history
[21:10] The connection Jesus and Islam
[28:45] What is the totalitarian impulse?
[29:30] "I think it is an understatement of the severity of the totalitarian problem to attribute it merely to the religious." - Jordan Peterson
[31:27] Critiquing the inevitable flaws of the purely secular state. The benefits of a higher law on the unification of people and not deifying human rulers
[34:59] "There is another value in Sharia law—[it] was separate from the rulers, even above the rulers." - Mustafa Akyol
[39:35] Briefly touching on the ruling class in Saudi Arabia. A brief history of the Wahhabi's rise to power, and how a group of extreme thinkers gained more power than would have been naturally possible
[45:36] Bad Ideas from the West are, in fact, devastating
[48:45] A modern Muslim's take on religion, power, and the birth of Islam with the prophet Muhammad
[55:15] "The whole thorny moral problem of what to do when you are being oppressed is not something let's say as a species we have figured out." - JBP
[01:18:51] "The inherent problem with literalism in interpretation. The perspective of the reader creates so much of the truth in this model that they can then impose on the world around them." - JBP
[01:26:20] Regarding reason and Sharia law, one group has said that Sharia indicates what's inherently right and wrong in the world. Another group, that it only creates that difference through the imposition
[01:27:01] Mary's role in the Quran and Islamic tradition
[01:31:29] The influence of gnostic Christian gospels on Muhammad in Mustafa's opinion. The odd state of the Jewish Christians who were accepted by neither side
[01:35:16] Final questions on Jesus Christ from Christian and Muslim perspectives
[01:43:35] Wrapping up

      <title>S4 E55: Exploring the Pareto Principle</title>
      <description>In this episode, we investigate the principle set forth by Vilfredo Pareto (an Economist born in 1848) which specifies that 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs. This principle serves as a general reminder that the relationship between inputs and outputs is not balanced. The Pareto Principle is also known as the Pareto Rule, the 80/20 Rule, or the Matthew Principle. 

﻿Jordan often uses the principle to demonstrate the harsh reality that inequality is not a simple issue, and therefore has no simple answer.

Sections:
[1:20] - 2017 Maps of Meaning 01 (Context and Background)
[10:45] - 2017 Personality 13 Existentialism via Solzhenitsyn and the Gulag
[17:01] - Biblical Series VIII The Phenomenology of the Divine
[21:34] - 12 Rules for Life Tour - Melbourne, Australia.

      <title>S4 E54: Death, Meaning, and the Power of the Invisible World | Clay Routledge | The JBP Podcast </title>
      <description>Welcome to the Jordan B Peterson podcast season 4, episode 54. This episode was recorded on June 14th, 2021. 

Dr. Clay Routledge is an existential psychologist, writer, and professor at North Dakota State University. He's also a senior research fellow at the Archbridge Institute and an editor for Profectus magazine. Dr. Routledge studies basic psychological needs and how they're shaped by family, social bonds, economics, and broader cultural worldviews. He has published over 100 scholarly papers, co-edited three books on existential psychology, and written several books, including Nostalgia: A Psychological Resource, Supernatural: Death, Meaning, and the Power of the Invisible World. 

A lot of Dr. Routledge’s work - like Dr. Peterson's - focuses on the need for meaning. The two had a wide-ranging conversation about loneliness, meaning, nostalgia, Terror Management Theory, and existential psychology. They also shared views on human progress, responsibility, religion, and UFOs.

      <title>S4 E42: Saving Humanities | Stephen Blackwood</title>
      <description>Dr. Stephen Blackwood: Philosopher, cultural critic and founder of Ralston College. 

Jordan Peterson and Dr. Stephen Blackwood discuss his work as founder of the Inner City Youth Program and his experience with developing Ralston College in Savannah, Georgia. We get into a deep discussion about the inner workings of philosophical aspects about social constructs, University and the humanities, the spiritual ‘culture crisis’ going on today, and more. 

Dr. Stephen Blackwood is the founding president of Ralston College in Savannah, Georgia. Dr. Blackwood specializes in the history of philosophy and dedicates a large portion of his work and studies on Boethius. He has contributed a great deal to several programs including the St. George’s YouthNet as well as an educational mentoring program for inner-city kids in Nova Scotia. Dr. Blackwood has been recognized by the floor of the US Senate due to his op-ed “ObamaCare and My Mother's Cancer Medicine” that reached the Wall Street Journal.

      <title>S4: E41: The Four Dos and Don'ts of Divorce | Warren Farrell</title>

      <title>S4E39: The End of Universities? | Jordan B. Peterson Podcast</title>
      <description>Yeonmi Park's account of her experience at Columbia University is harrowing - as someone who had just arrived in the West after her escape from North Korea, the idea that she had to censor herself at a prestigious university like Columbia, or any university for that matter -  which have historically been bastions of free thought is horrifying. Her experience serves as one example of just how far the Universities have deteriorated.

Dr. Peterson wanted to put this together because he still feels like it’s possible to save the Universities, but before that can happen, more people need to be aware of just how twisted they’ve become. Feel free to share and reference this video as some evidence and perspectives on the state of Western Universities.

      <description>This episode was recorded on May 10th 2021.

Jordan Peterson’s guest today is distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of New Mexico, American entomologist and evolutionary biologist, Dr. Randy Thornhill.

Dr. Thornhill’s research shines an enticing light on scientific areas that most people have never been exposed to. We come to understand and appreciate the importance of evolutionary biology in shaping our opinions, attitudes, and in many cases the decisions we make throughout our lives. Dr. Thornhill has authored and co-authored around 250 scientific publications, and a majority of his work has been cited in scientific literature over 35,000 times.

Dr. Thornhill shares his findings on attractiveness including cryptic female choice, symmetry, carotenoid pigments, and the characteristics of attractiveness. They also cover Dr. Thornhill’s parasite-stress theory, the critical role that infectious disease plays in humanity, IQ, sex, religion, and conservatism.

      <description>This podcast was recorded on May 14th, 2021.

In today’s episode, Dr. Jordan Peterson is accompanied by author Brian Muraresku and Professor Carl Ruck to unravel the secrets of ancient Greek culture and religion. They embark upon the sinuous journey of discussing psychedelics in Ancient Greek religion, and how both Brian and Professor Ruck became deeply invested in understanding the subject.

Today we meet with Brian Muraresku, who tells us why and how he was drawn to research the role of psychedelics within Western civilization. Muraresku is also the author of The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion With No Name.

Carl Ruck is an American professor who’s known for his extensive research on mythology and religion regarding the sacred role of entheogens; a selection of psychoactive plants that are known for inducing altered states of reality or consciousness. Ruck co-authored the book The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries, and is currently teaching mythology classes supporting this theory at Boston University.

      <title>S4 E19: Brave Art | Randall Wallace - Jordan B Peterson Podcast </title>
      <description>Randall Wallace, graduate of Duke University, is an American NYT bestselling author of seven novels, as well as a screenwriter (TV and film), director, producer, songwriter, holder of a black belt in karate, and founder of Hollywood for Habitat for Humanity. He is perhaps best known for writing the historical drama Braveheart (1995), which earned him a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay and an Academy Award nomination in the same category, but has since directed The Man in the Iron Mask (1998), We Were Soldiers (2002), Secretariat (2010) and Heaven Is for Real (2014). Mr. Wallace also penned the lyrics to the acclaimed hymn Mansions of the Lord (music by Nick Glennie-Smith), featured in the soundtrack of When We Were Soldiers and performed as the recessional for President Ronald Reagan's funeral. 
Mr. Wallace and I discussed the power of art, music and story, his unlikely stint writing songs for an animal band, the profound influence of Biblical stories on his work and thought, the experience of depression, the necessity and significance of sacrifice, the general development of his career as a successful Hollywood writer and director, and his upcoming action movie about the Pope.

      <title>S4E17: The Grace Church High School Controversy: Teaching and the Voice of Conscience with Paul Rossi and Jordan Peterson</title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on April 22nd, 2021
Paul Rossi and I sit down to discuss the controversy surrounding a recent article Paul wrote. It has become apparent that an anti-racism curriculum is being instituted in schools across the United States and that doesn’t initially sound like anything but a positive change. I had Paul on to share his concerns after working in one of these schools that are implementing new ways of thinking about how our western society is structured. We spoke about many of the flaws we see with the current direction of teaching.
Paul Rossi is a high school mathematics teacher and writer. His April 21st, 2021 essay titled “I Refuse to Stand by While my Students are Indoctrinated” was published on Bari Weiss’ Substack “Common Sense with Bari Weiss”.

      <title>S4E16: Is Everything Better Than We Think?: Bjorn Lomborg </title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on January 21, 2021.

Dr. Bjorn Lomborg and I discuss a variety of topics in the realm of climate change and worldwide problems. We examine the claims made in his latest book False Alarm. Throughout the episode we touch on sustainable development goals, prioritizing problems for the world, achieving the highest return on investment, the apocalypse lens we apply to many global issues, making the poor richer, innovation, adaptation, selling and marketing solutions, and much more.

Dr. Bjorn Lomborg is a Danish author and President of the think tank, Copenhagen Consensus Center. Bjorn champions a path to solving world problems through the use of economic research to determine where to spend our resources based on the return on investment and severity of the impending issue. Dr. Lomborg’s more notable books include False Alarm and How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.

      <title>S4E13: Jocko Willink</title>
      <description>This episode was recorded on 03/12/21
I had the pleasure of inviting Jocko Willink on to my podcast for the first time, I’ve been on Jocko’s podcast several times in the past and now get the opportunity to reverse the interviewing role to learn more about his life and endeavors. We discuss his experience in the military and war exploring time in the Navy Seals, Afganistan, and Iraq. Jocko recount what it looks like to be on the ground in combat scenarios and the requirement of strong leadership in the Seal teams. I ask him about his formative years growing up with a warrior personality. We cover other engaging points of interest in his kid books, time as an English major, restarting a clothing line in a dying factory town, and much more.
Jocko Willink is an American author, podcaster, and retired naval officer who served in the Navy SEALs. His books include New Tork Times bestseller Extreme Ownership,  Discipline Equals Freedom a field manual, and his children’s book The Way of the Warrior Kid. Jocko also has one of the most successful podcasts out there so check out the Jocko Podcast.

      <title>MPP: Mark Manson with Jordan and Mikhaila Peterson</title>
      <link>https://jordanbpetersonpodcast.libsyn.com/mark-manson-relationships-and-responsibilities</link>

In this episode, we spoke with Mark Manson, a best-selling author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, and more recently, Everything Is F*cked: A Book about Hope, which has sold over thirteen million copies worldwide. He’s also a very popular blogger.
We discussed how to properly set goals, the destabilizing effects of social media, the value of committed relationships, and responsibility. We compared experiences as authors that fit into the self-help category and our search for meaning as men inside and outside of religion.

      <description>This episode was recorded on January 15, 2021.
Douglas Murray and I discuss, among other topics, the collapse of grand narratives on the left and the right alike, the potential for the resultant explanatory and motivational void to be filled by more radical ideological ideas, and the dangers posed by the mutual recrimination that all-too-frequently characterizes relationships across the left-right divide.
Douglas Murray is a British best-selling author (The Madness of Crowds and  The Strange Death of Europe) and a columnist and associate editor at The Spectator (UK). He is an award-winning journalist that has contributed to many papers and publications in the US and UK.

      <link>https://jordanbpetersonpodcast.libsyn.com/-heidegger-binswanger-boss-phenomenology</link>
      <description>In this lecture, 12th in the 2017 series, I discuss Heidegger's phenomenological philosophy of Being, interpreted through the eyes of the psychotherapists Ludwig Binswanger and Medard Boss. The phenomenologists were attempting to reduce the painful separation between object and subject that has as one of its consequences the elimination of meaning from existence.

"Hosted by Taraji P. Henson, Wondery (Dr. Death, Dirty John, The Shrink Next Door) and Universal Music Group present Jacked: Rise of the New Jack Sound.

 The story begins with a keyboard player in the heart of Harlem: Teddy Riley. Teddy’s entire world was music. Playing it. Composing it. Producing it. Teddy and his friend Timmy Gatling followed their dreams and started a revolution in the world of hip-hop and R&amp;B.They crafted hit after hit, and were on top of the world.
 Their group’s quick rise to fame came with betrayals and broken friendships. Tensions within the band began to flare, and rivalries with other artists turned violent. As the stakes grew higher,
 their troubled manager pushed the group past their breaking point, with deadly results.

      <title>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (Existentialism)</title>
      <link>https://jordanbpetersonpodcast.libsyn.com/aleksandr-solzhenitsyn</link>
      <description>--From: 2014 Personality Lecture 13: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (Existentialism)--
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, perhaps the greatest Russian author of the twentieth century, was an Orthodox Christian existentialist, a direct descendant of Dostoevsky's thinking, and a man who took a mighty axe to the terrible tangled roots of communist totalitarianism. He associated inauthentic being on the part of the individual, within society, with the direct degeneration of that society into tyranny and malevolence.

      <title>Foreword to The Gulag Archipelago: 50th Anniversary</title>
      <link>https://jordanbpetersonpodcast.libsyn.com/professor-against-political-correctness-part-1</link>
      <description>I had the great privilege of writing the foreword to the 50th-anniversary version of the abridged version of one of the most important books of the 20th century, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago, a devastating account of the absolute horror wreaked upon the people of the Soviet Empire by the acolytes of the doctrine of Karl Marx. I read the foreword here, in its entirety, and encourage everyone to purchase and study the book. It changed the world.
The 50th-anniversary version of The Gulag Archipelago is available at Amazon UK at https://amzn.to/2CQ8O6O or at multiple booksellers on the dedicated Penguin Random House page at
 https://bit.ly/2Q2CUrb
NOTE: The North American license is held by Harper Collins, and the book is not available in its 50th-anniversary form except from the sellers above.

      <title>Maps of Meaning 12: Final - The Divinity of the Individual</title>
      <link>https://jordanbpetersonpodcast.libsyn.com/maps-of-meaning-12-final-the-divinity-of-the-individual</link>
      <description>In this, the final Maps of Meaning lecture for 2017, Dr. Peterson reviews the year and its offerings: What is a belief system? Why are people so inclined to engage in conflict to protect their belief systems?
It's partly because our belief systems are not only systems of belief, but structures that serve to render everyone who participates in that belief and its dramatization and acting out in the world predictable, trustworthy and cooperative (even when competing).
Is there a hierarchy of rank or value among belief systems, or are they merely arbitrary?
What is the relationship between descriptions of the objective world and moral guidelines? How do you determine how to conduct yourself in the world? What should you do (and is that question even genuine -- or answerable?)
What inbuilt structures do you bring into the world, as a consequence of biological evolution, that help you orient yourself in life, in the face of its overwhelming complexity? What is the relationship between the games that children learn to play when becoming socialized and the cultural structures that guide us in broader society? How is all this related to the underlying symbolic structures (religious structures) that sit at the base of our societies and belief structures?

      <title>Maps of Meaning 09: Patterns of Symbolic Representation</title>
      <link>https://jordanbpetersonpodcast.libsyn.com/maps-of-meaning-09-patterns-of-symbolic-representation</link>
      <description>In this lecture, Dr. Peterson discusses the manner in which the fundamental symbolic archetypes (particularly those dealing with the Wise King and Tyrant) are hijacked for the purposes of propaganda. Ideologies are parasites. Their hosts are archetypes. Knowledge of the underlying archetypes can produce immunity against ideological possession.

      <link>https://jordanbpetersonpodcast.libsyn.com/maps-of-meaning-08-neuropsychology-of-symbolic-representation</link>
      <description>In this lecture, Dr. Peterson discusses the relationship between the basic categories of imagistic/symbolic representation and brain function, noting that the very hemispheres of the brain are adapted, right/left to the environmental or experiential permanence of chaos/order or unexplored/explored territory, with consciousness serving the Logos role of communicative explorer (a function related in one of its deepest manifestations to the function of the hypothalamically grounded dopaminergic systems).

      <title>Maps of Meaning 07: Images of Story &amp; Metastory</title>
      <link>https://jordanbpetersonpodcast.libsyn.com/maps-of-meaning-07-images-of-story-metastory</link>
      <description>In this lecture, Dr. Peterson discusses how the basic or archetypal categories we use to frame the world are represented in image, where they existed long before their nature could be articulated. These categories include the individual (hero/adversary), culture (wise king/tyrant), and nature (destruction/creation). The heroic individual (the knower) is typically masculine, as is culture (the known), while the unknown is feminine. These categories can be conceptualized, as well, as explorer, explored territory, and unexplored territory. The most abstract category is the dragon of chaos, the monster who guards what is most valuable. It is from this most primordial of categories that the other three emerge. Our existence as prey and predator is reflected in the ambivalent representation of the absolute unknown.

      <title>Maps of Meaning 06: Story and Metastory (Part 2)</title>
      <link>https://jordanbpetersonpodcast.libsyn.com/maps-of-meaning-06-story-and-metastory-part-2</link>
      <description>In this lecture, Professor Peterson discusses uncertainty or anomaly. We frame the world -- or the world reveals itself to us -- as a story, with a starting point, a destination, and the behavioral means to move from one to the other. The destination is valued more highly than the starting point, and constitutes the point of the story -- the aim of the individual. Reality manifests itself within that story as what is relevant for forward movement, what gets in the way, and what is irrelevant and can be safely ignored. The largest category, by far, is the latter. Unfortunately, sometimes what has been happily classified as irrelevant rears up and gets in the way. That's a manifestation of chaos. Chaos can undermine the story, or break the frame. The degree of undermining or breakage is proportional to the time and space over which the story in question extends its operations.

      <description>In this lecture, I make the case that we each inhabit a story, describing where we are, where we are going, and the actions we must undertake to get from the former to the latter. These inhabited stories are predicated on an underlying value system (as we must want to be where we are going more than we value where we are). In addition, they are frames of reference, allowing us to perceive (things that move us along; things that get in our way), make most of the world irrelevant (things that have no bearing

      <title>36 - Joseph and the Coat of Many Colors</title>
      <link>http://www.blubrry.com/jordanbpeterson/29878282/</link>
      <description>Lecture 14 in my Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories lecture series. This lecture closes 2017, and the book of Genesis. In it, I present the story of Joseph who, as the wearer of the coat of many colors, is profoundly adaptable, courageous, adaptable, merciful and just. Even in slavery -- even in prison -- he comes out triumphant, because of the strength of his character and his wisdom. Betrayed by his brothers, he acts to strengthen his family; unjustly accused by the Pharaoh's wife

This seems to reflect the pattern of human life: the journey towards a goal, or destination, and the completion of a stage or epoch of life, followed by the necessity of revelati

The man portrayed in the Bible as the father of nations moves forward into the world. He encounters the worst of nature (famine), society (the tyranny of Egypt) and the envy of the powerful, who desire his wife. There is nothing easy about Abraham's life. Instead, he is portrayed both

In a few short sentences, it outlines two diametrically opposed modes of being -- both responses to the emergence of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil detailed in story of Adam and Eve. Cain's mode of being -- resentful, arrogant and murderous -- arises because his sacrifices are rejected by God. This means

In its few short paragraphs, it covers: the emergence of human self-consciousness; mankind's attendant realization of vulnerability, mortality, and death; the origin of the capacity for willful evil, as the ability to exploit that newly-realized vulnerability; the emergence of shame as a consequenc

      <description>Lecture 3 in my Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories series at the Isabel Bader Theatre in Toronto. Although I thought I might get to Genesis II in this third lecture, and begin talking about Adam &amp; Eve, it didn't turn out that way. There was more to be said about the idea of God as creator (with the Word as the process underlying the act of creation). I didn't mind, because it is very important to get God and the Creation of the Universe right before moving on :) . In this lecture

      <description>Lecture 2 in my Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories. In this lecture, I present Genesis 1, which presents the idea that a pre-existent cognitive structure (God the Father) uses the Logos, the Christian Word, the second Person of the Trinity, to generate habitable order out of precosmogonic chaos at the beginning of time. It is in that Image that Man and Woman are created -- indicating, perhaps, that it is (1) through speech that we participate in the creation of the cosmos of experie

      <description>Lecture 1 in my Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories series from May 16th at Isabel Bader Theatre in Toronto. In this lecture, I describe what I consider to be the idea of God, which is at least partly the notion of sovereignty and power, divorced from any concrete sovereign or particular, individual person of power. I also suggest that God, as Father, is something akin to the spirit or pattern inherent in the human hierarchy of authority, which is based in turn on the dominance hierarchies ch

      <link>http://www.blubrry.com/jordanbpeterson/19256928/</link>
      <description>In a public lecture recorded by TVO, Dr Peterson describes the way the world is portrayed in deep stories, such as myths and religious representations.

Culture is typically represented as paternal, nature as maternal, and the individual as hero and adversary. Culture offers people security, but threatens them with tyranny. Nature offers renewal, but also brings death.
